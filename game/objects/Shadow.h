/* Shadows
 * The plan is to divide up what is below an object
 * in levels and then make rectangular images to display
 * on each separate y level
 * They will be simple rectangles
 * There will be a derivative for entities which use a pixel perfect
 * circle below the player, which has a performant mode of using
 * a isometric circle image which only uses 1 y level
